VARARGS
-------

* and ** support functions to take any number of arguments.

* - tuple
** - dictionary, only works for keyword arguments

* and ** can also be used when calling a function.

these techniques are convenient when we can not predict the number of arguments that will be passed to a function.

* works for files (any iteable object)

func(*open('fname')

Functions objects can also be passed to functions just like any other object

def kwonly(a, *b, c): # here c must be passed by keywork only

def kwonly(a, *, b, c): # a may be passed by position or keyword but b and c should be passed by keyword only

def kwonly(a, *, b='spam', c='ham'): # b and c are optional, if given they should be passed using keyword only

named arguments can not appear after **
